# ml-learning

A comprehensive learning repository covering **Python programming**, **Mathematics for Machine Learning (Linear Algebra & Calculus)**, and **Data Visualization**.
This repo is designed as a self-learning journey with notebooks, examples, and code snippets.

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository serves as a foundation for building strong skills in:

* 🐍 **Python Basics** – syntax, data structures, functions, OOP
* 📊 **Mathematics for ML**

  * Linear Algebra – vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, transformations
  * Calculus – derivatives, gradients, optimization
* 📈 **Data Visualization** – matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
* 🤖 **Machine Learning (intro level)** – connecting math concepts to ML

It’s structured for beginners and intermediate learners who want a step-by-step approach.
